# Express-Basic
This is my Express Basic Source Code. It's about basic syntax in express.js , handlebars and API.
My Server is Running on Port 5000. In my project I use Handlebars as an Engine that is used to make infrastructure of Website. My website involves adding data via Form with Name and Email. Using API to create User, browse User , Edit User and Delete User via Extension called Thunder Client that my friend suggested that it can be used instead of Postman for use in API testing.
